Em             Am       D          Em 
The angel Gabriel from heaven came;
        Em            C         Am       D7 
His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame,
       Em                      C          Am  D7
''All hail'' said he, ''thou lowly maiden Ma--ry,
       C             D7    Em   Am    D7 
Most highly favored lady, Glo--oooo--ria!''
Em     D7    Em 
(Glo--oooo--ria!)

Em             Am       D          Em 
''For known a blessed mother thou shalt be,
        Em            C         Am       D7 
All generations laud and honor thee,
       Em                      C          Am  D7
Thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold,
        C             D7    Em   Am    D7 
Most highly favored lady.'' Gloria!
Em     D7    Em 
(Gloria!)

Em             Am       D          Em 
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head, 
        Em            C         Am       D7 
''To me be as it pleaseth God,'' she said, 
       Em                      C          Am  D7
''My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name,'' 
       C             D7    Em   Am    D7 
Most highly favoured lady, Gloria! 
Em     D7    Em 
(Gloria!)
